# Applying-High-pass-Filter-to-audio-file-with-variable-cutoff-frequency-20Hz-1Khz-input-by-user-
This project aims to implement a high-pass filter for audio files with a variable cutoff frequency. The user will be able to input the desired cutoff frequency within a range of 20Hz to 1kHz, and the program will apply the filter accordingly to the audio file provided.
